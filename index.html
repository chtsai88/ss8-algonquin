          <h2>Geography, Location</h2>
          The Algonquian Indians near the coast of the North Carolina is the southernmost part of the entire Algonquin tribe. The subtropical coast and coastal plain is flat with many lakes and swamps.
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li> Fish, clams, and oysters are plenty in the water of this subtropical region.</li>
            <li> Deers, rabbits, and foxes are also plentiful.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          The entire Algonquin tribe stretch as far north as Canada, and North Carolina is only a very small part of it.

          During the summer the group would go fishing and socializing, summer the group would go fishing and socializing but at the approach of winter they separated in into hunting camps of extended families. The climate was harsh, with starvation not uncommon. For this reason, the Algonquin could not afford for someone. THey do the same things all children do--play with each other, go to school help around the house. Many Algonquin children like to go hunting and fishing with their fathers. In the past, Indian kids had more chores and less time to play, like early colonial children. But they did have toys, games and dolls like this 18th century doll in its miniature their babies in cradleboards on their backs--a custom which many American parents have adopted now. Algonquin women gathered plants to eat and did most of the child care and cooking. Men are hunters and sometimes went to war to protect their families. Both genders took part in storytelling, artwork  and music, and traditional medicine. In the past, the Algonquin Indian chief was always a man, but today a women can be chief too.

          The Algonquins usually wore little clothing.  They made most of their clothing from elk and deer hides. They decorated them with shells, stones, seeds, paint, dyes and porcupine needles. They also were belts, leggings and moccasins. The Algonquin Indian tribe was famous for their birchbark canoes. Canoeing is still popular in the Algonquin nation today. Over land, the Algonquins used dogs as pack animals. (There were no horses in North America until colonists brought them over from Europe.) The ALgonquin used sleds and snowshoes to help them travel in the winter. Today, of of course, ALgonquin people also use cars… and non-native people also us canoes.          <img src='./left%20to%20go%20home.png'>
